Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
============================

A small C++ library to perform 2 class Linear Discriminant Analysis using Eigen Library for <b>OpenCV</b>.

This was highly inspired by <a href="http://www-ist.massey.ac.nz/smarsland/MLBook.html">Stephen Marshland's "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective"</a>
implementation in Python and also based on <a href="http://www.bytefish.de/">Byte Fish </a> implementation of the LDA in C++.

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a statistical techinque which is used in dimensionality reduction and also for classification of data.

In order to build it, follow the instructions on this page http://www.developerstation.org/2012/05/linear-discriminant-analysis-using.html

NOTE:
This code is in Beta and may be buggy. Its currently under development.
