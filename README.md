Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
============================

A small C++ library to perform Linear Discriminant Analysis using Eigen Library for OpenCV.

This was highly inspired by <a href="http://www-ist.massey.ac.nz/smarsland/MLBook.html">Stephen Marshland's "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective"</a>
implementation in Python and also based on <a href="http://www.bytefish.de/">Byte Fish </a> implementation of the LDA in C++.

NOTE:

This code is in Beta and currently under development.
