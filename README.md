Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
============================

A small C++ library to perform 2 class Linear Discriminant Analysis using Eigen Library for OpenCV.

This was highly inspired by <a href="http://www-ist.massey.ac.nz/smarsland/MLBook.html">Stephen Marshland's "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective"</a>
implementation in Python and also based on <a href="http://www.bytefish.de/">Byte Fish </a> implementation of the LDA in C++.

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a statistical techinque which is used in dimensionality reduction and also for classification of data.


NOTE:
This code is in Beta and currently under development.
